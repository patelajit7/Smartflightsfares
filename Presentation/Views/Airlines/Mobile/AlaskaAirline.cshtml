                    <h5>Some things to remember when booking a flight with Alaska Airlines</h5>
                    <ul class="list w_50">
                        <li>Cuisine of the region: It's always a good idea to learn a little about the cuisine provided while visiting a new area. Food in the United States of America, for example, is influenced by the many ethnic backgrounds of its citizens. In Chicago, get deep-dish pizza; in New York, order bagels; and in the southern regions, order BBQ.</li>
                        <li>Sockets and Plugs: Knowing how to use the sockets and plugs at a foreign holiday area is one of the most important things a traveller should know. Plug sockets A and B are used in the United States. The standard voltage is 120 V, with a 60 Hz frequency. Make sure you have an adaptor on hand if you'll need one.</li>
                        <li>Money: If one wants to get the most out of a trip, he or she should be conversant with the destination country's money. The dollar, for example, is the official currency of the United States (USD). Credit and debit cards, as well as cash, are accepted by the majority of eateries.</li>
                        <li>Customs and culture: Learning about the customs and culture of a location is a good habit to acquire. In the United States, tipping is common, with roughly 10% added to the total in restaurants and pubs. Taxi drivers and hotel employees are also expected to tip.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Booking a flight with Alaska Airlines: Best Practices</h4>

                    <ul class="list w_50">
                        <li>When flying with Alaska Airlines, take advantage of the award-winning lounges and in-flight entertainment selections.</li>

                        <li>Make your vacation dates as flexible as possible. It's unusual for the price of a flight to increase on certain days. You can check flight rates and choose the lowest alternative by changing the dates. To save the most money, use the credit cards that provide the most discounts on Etihad airline bookings.</li>
                        <li>Book your Alaska Airlines flight at least a couple weeks in advance. You may receive significantly reduced airfares and fly for a fraction of the price when there is limited demand for a flight.</li>
