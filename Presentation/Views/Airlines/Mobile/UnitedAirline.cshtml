                    </p>
                    <ul class="list w_50">
                        <li>
                            Keep your trip dates as ad hoc as you can. It's rare for the price of a particular flight to rise on specific days. Adjustable dates can be used to compare flight prices and select the most cost-effective option. Use the appropriate credit cards to get excellent discounts on Etihad lights.
                        </li>

                            Verify your United Airlines reservations at least a few weeks ahead of time. When there is little demand for a flight, you might just get dramatically discounted prices and fly for a small fraction of the cost.
