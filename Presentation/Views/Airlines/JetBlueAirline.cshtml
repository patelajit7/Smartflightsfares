                    <ul class="list w_50">
                        <li>Cuisine of the region: When visiting a new place, it's usually a good idea to understand a little about the cuisine served there. Food in the United States of America, for example, is impacted by its residents' many ethnic origins. Try deep-dish pizza in Chicago, bagels in New York, and BBQ in the southern states.</li>
                        <li>Sockets and Plugs: The sockets and plugs used in a foreign vacation destination are one of the most significant pieces of information that a tourist should be aware of. In the United States, plug sockets A and B are utilised. The standard voltage is 120 V, and the frequency is 60 Hz. If you'll need an adapter, be sure you have one on hand.</li>
                        <li>Money: If one wants to get the most out of a trip, one must be familiar with the currency of the target country. The official currency of the United States, for example, is the dollar (USD). The majority of restaurants take credit and debit cards, as well as cash.</li>
                        <li>Customs and culture: Learning about a place's customs and culture is a beneficial habit to develop. Tipping is prevalent in the United States, with around 10% added to the total at restaurants and bars. Tipping is also demanded of taxi drivers and hotel personnel.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Best Practices while booking a flight with JetBlue Airways</h4>
                    <p>SmartFlights Fares will go to great lengths to ensure that your JetBlue Airways flight booking is a pleasant and memorable experience. To get the most out of SmartFlights Fares and your journey, follow these recommendations and advice.</p>
                    <ul class="list w_50">
                        <li>Take advantage of the award-winning lounges and in-flight entertainment options while travelling with JetBlue Airways.</li>
                        <li>Register with SmartFlights Fares and switch on alerts to ensure you never miss out on the newest JetBlue Airways Flight Tickets discounts and seasonal deals.</li>
                        <li>Make your vacation dates as ad hoc as you can. It is rare for the cost of a flight to rise on specific days. By altering the dates, you may compare flight prices and pick the cheapest option. Use the essential credit cards that provide the most discounts on Etihad airline reservations to save the most money.</li>
                        <li>Make your JetBlue Airways reservations at least a few weeks ahead of time. When there is a low demand for a flight, you can get considerably discounted flights and fly for a fraction of the price.</li>
